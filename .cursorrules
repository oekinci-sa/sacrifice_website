#PROJECT

Project Name: Sacrifice Website
Project Description: The project is actually very similar to an e-commerce site. It is a site about the Muslim sacrifice ritual. Muslim users enter the site and choose a sacrificial animal and buy one or more shares. Then, with the code verification sent to their mobile phones, they can make sure that their registration is done and download a PDF printout. In addition, more than one admin can manage and monitor the project via an admin panel.

The features of the pages are as follows
Public Pages:

- / -> Page where general information about the organization is given.
- /hakkimizda -> Page where the organizers of the organization are explained
- /hisseal -> Where the animal is chosen and personal information such as name and surname is entered for the shares received from the animals. Then, they receive the relevant information as an SMS message to their phones. There will be no online payment on the site. Fees will be collected in cash.
    There are two tabs on this page: Share Selection and Share Approval

    Share Selection Tab:
    There is a table and there is a share buy button on each row. If the empty share count is 0, the button appears as passive. When the button on the rows with empty shares is pressed, a pop-up opens and a question is asked how many shares you want to select? Here, a decrease occurs in the db according to the value selected by the user. Then, the system takes us to the Share Approval tab.

    Share Approval Tab:
    Here, an accordion menu is formed as many as the number of shares selected and there is some shareholder information such as name and surname in them.

    There is also an "Add New Shareholder" button on this page. This button will add the new shareholder if there is space in the database (it should learn this by querying the db) and will decrease the empty_share value from the db.

    In case everything is positive, the user presses the approve button and this shareholder information is written to the shareholders table and the person is directed to the share inquiry screen.

    However, there may be some negative situations.
        1. For example, a person can keep the page open for 10 minutes while filling out a form, but this time other users cannot select these shares. There should be a timeout for this. For example, if the person does not perform any action within 3 minutes, a pop-up warning will be displayed to the user with 1 minute left in the form, with a countdown.

        And if the user is still inactive when the time is up, the empty_share field should increase by the number of accordions that have occurred.

        2. Another negative situation is when the person closes the tab completely or leaves the current page on this tab. In this case, the empty_share field should increase by the number of accordions that have occurred before the person leaves the page or the page is completely closed. (These negative situations can be controlled with the Beacon API.)

        You don't need to return to the share selection tab when the window or the changes are made, this should only happen when there is a timeout.

- /hissesorgula -> Later, the area where the share information is queried with the code sent to their mobile phones and users can get a PDF printout.
- /yazilar -> Blog page with articles about sacrifice worship
- /iletisim -> Page where those who want to contact the institution can get information

Admin Pages:

- /kurban-admin/genel-bakis -> A page with some general information such as the number of animals, money collected, etc. and graphic table visualizations
- /kurban-admin/kurbanliklar
    - Some Graphs
    - Page with a table of sacrifices and access to special pages for these sacrifices.
  - /kurban-admin/kurbanliklar/ayrintilar/[id] -> Page with a table of shareholders and access to special pages for these shareholders.
- /kurban-admin/hissedarlar
    - Some Graphs
    - Page with a table of shareholders and access to special pages for these sacrifices.
- /kurban-admin/kullanici-yonetimi -> Page where users can be managed.
- /kurban-admin/degisiklik-kayitlari -> Page where change logs can be viewed.

#COMPONENT FEATURES

Table Components
I am showing some rows in color in the table element. Pay attention to the following while coloring.
- When using green color, text color: #39C645 background color: #F0FBF1
- When using red color, text color: #D22D2D background color: #FCEFEF
- When using yellow color, text color: #F9BC06 background color: #FFFAEC

Sidebar Component

- The sidebar should have narrow and wide view features.
- When the sidebar is minimized, the icons related to it should be visible.
- The information of the logged in user should be on the bottom left of the sidebar. Dark - light mode selection should be possible as a feature in this menu.

#PAGE FEATURES

Admin Pages: The general layout should be as follows:

- A sidebar on the left. Its feature was given in the "Component Features" part

#TECH STACK

Frontend: React 18, Next JS 14, TypeScript, Shadcn, Shadcn Charts, TailwindCSS

- All TypeScript definitions should be organized under the types folder.
- All forms should include react-hook-form and Zod validations.
- Server state management → React Query
- Client state (UI state) management → Zustand veya useState
- All pages should be designed for both desktop and mobile. Because it will be accessed 99% of the time from mobile by customers.
- I want to use shadcn as the design system; apart from that, everything should follow a clear standard without unnecessary deviations.
- Use shadcn if possible, otherwise create componenet with tailwindcss
- UI has dark mode feature. So choose the color scheme accordingly.
- At the end of the process of writing or deleting or updating something to the database from the frontend, inform the user whether the process is positive or negative with shadcn toast components.

Backend: Supabase

- Use supabaseClient from /utils/supabaseClient.ts
- I Have three tables in the database.
- The sacrifice_animals and sacrifice_no tables in the shareholders tables are connected to each other with a foreign key (sacrifice_id).
- When an operation is performed on the database, show a notification about the result with shadcn toast notifications. For example, your operation could not be performed: (Explanation)

Table 1: sacrifice_animals and its fields are: 
  - sacrifice_id: Primary key (a unique identifier). 
  - sacrifice_no: Sacrifice number (a unique identifier). 
  - sacrifice_time: The time of the sacrifice operation. 
  - share_price: The price of a share. 
  - total_price: The price of a sacrifice animal. (share_price * 7)
  - empty_share: The number of remaining empty shares. Maximum number is 7 and minimum number is 0.
  - last_edited_time: The date and time when the sacrifice information was last edited. There is a trigger in the database that updates this field when the sacrifice information is edited.
  - last_edited_by: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - notes: Additional information or notes.

Table 2: shareholders and its fields are:
  - shareholder_id: Primary key (a unique identifier field).
  - shareholder_name: The name of the shareholder.
  - phone_number: The phone number of the shareholder. -> varchar(13)
        When we receive an input from users regarding a phone_number, we will definitely check it and send it to db as +905555555555, but when we show it to users in the frontend, we should remove the +9 at the beginning and show it as 05555555555.
  - purchase_time: The time of share purchase. Default value is (now() AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Istanbul'::text) so don't send backend to this column value.
  - sacrifice_id: The associated sacrifice (foreign key). 
  - delivery_fee: Delivery fee. If the delivery type is "Toplu Teslim Noktası," an additional fee of 500 TL will be charged.
  - share_price: The price of a share associated with the sacrifice. This will comes from the sacrifice_animals table.
  - total_amount: The total amount to be paid. (share_price + delivery_fee)
  - paid_amount: The paid amount. (initial value is 0)
  - remaining_payment: The remaining payment amount. (total_amount - paid_amount)
  - delivery_type: Delivery type (e.g., "kesimhane", "toplu-teslim-noktasi"). 
  - delivery_location: If Delivery type is "toplu-teslim-noktasi", this will be only two options: "yenimahalle-pazar-yeri" or "kecioren-otoparki". Otherwise "kesimhane".
  - sacrifice_consent: This a boolean value in db. But it is displayed as "vekalet" in UI and in forms, this field is shown in the drop-down menu as "vekalet-alindi" or "vekalet-alinmadi".
  - last_edited_time: The date and time when the shareholder information was last edited. There is a trigger in the database that updates this field when the shareholder information is edited.
  - last_edited_by: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - notes: Additional information or notes.

Table 3: change_logs and its fields are: 
  - event_id: Primary key - serial (a unique identifier field). 
  - table_name: Specifies which table was modified.
  - row_id: The ID of the modified record.
  - column_name: Column name where the change was made.
  - old_value
  - new_value
  - change_type: The type of operation performed (e.g., "Ekleme", "Güncelleme", "Silme"). 
  - description: Description of the change. 
  - change_owner: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - changed_at: The date and time when the change was made. 

Your are not limited to these if you find a more clean solution. But mention about the situation using other frameworks or libraries etc.

#YOUR RULES

- Component Organization Guidelines: Design website based on components. Do not stuff code into a single page. Here’s a clear and structured prompt for this approach: When creating pages, follow this structure for organizing components:
  1.	Page-Specific Components:
      - If a component is only used within a specific page, create a components folder inside that page's directory.
      - Example: For a page at /app/dashboard, store its components under /app/dashboard/components.
  2.	Section-Specific Components:
      - If a component is used across multiple pages within a section (Ex: kurban-admin/odeme-analizi, kurban-admin/hissedarlar etc.), create a components folder inside the section's directory.
      - Example: For /app/kurban-admin/, use /app/kurban-admin/components.
  3.	Global Components:
      - If a component is used across multiple sections or the entire project, store it inside /components/custom-components.
      - Example: A generic Modal or Button component should be placed in /components/custom-components.
  By following this structure, components remain modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- Don't make any UI changes that I haven't told you about without asking me. You can write it to me as a suggestion, but if I say okay, you can apply it.
- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Don't remove comment lines.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Correct linter errors and warnings.
