#PROJECT

Project Name: Sacrifice Website
Project Description: The project is actually very similar to an e-commerce site. It is a site about the Muslim sacrifice ritual. Muslim users enter the site and choose a sacrificial animal and buy one or more shares. Then, with the code verification sent to their mobile phones, they can make sure that their registration is done and download a PDF printout. In addition, more than one admin can manage and monitor the project via an admin panel.

The features of the pages are as follows
Public Pages:

- / -> Page where general information about the organization is given.
- /hakkimizda -> Page where the organizers of the organization are explained
- /hisseal -> Where the animal is chosen and personal information such as name and surname is entered for the shares received from the animals. Then, they receive the relevant information as an SMS message to their phones. There will be no online payment on the site. Fees will be collected in cash.
- /hissesorgula -> Later, the area where the share information is queried with the code sent to their mobile phones and users can get a PDF printout.
- /yazilar -> Blog page with articles about sacrifice worship
- /iletisim -> Page where those who want to contact the institution can get information

#TECH STACK

Frontend: React 18, Next JS 14, TypeScript, Shadcn, Shadcn Charts, TailwindCSS

- All TypeScript definitions should be organized under the types folder.
- All forms should include react-hook-form and Zod validations.
- All pages should be designed for both desktop and mobile. Because it will be accessed 99% of the time from mobile by customers.
- I want to use shadcn as the design system; apart from that, everything should follow a clear standard without unnecessary deviations.
- Use shadcn if possible, otherwise create componenet with tailwindcss
- UI has dark mode feature. So choose the color scheme accordingly.
- At the end of the process of writing or deleting or updating something to the database from the frontend, inform the user whether the process is positive or negative with shadcn toast components.

Backend: Supabase

- Use supabaseClient from /utils/supabaseClient.ts
- I Have three tables in the database.
- The sacrifice_animals and sacrifice_no tables in the shareholders tables are connected to each other with a foreign key (sacrifice_id).
- When an operation is performed on the database, show a notification about the result with shadcn toast notifications. For example, your operation could not be performed: (Explanation)

Table 1: sacrifice_animals and its fields are: 
  - sacrifice_id: Primary key (a unique identifier). 
  - sacrifice_no: Sacrifice number (a unique identifier). 
  - sacrifice_time: The time of the sacrifice operation. 
  - share_price: The price of a share. 
  - total_price: The price of a sacrifice animal. (share_price * 7)
  - empty_share: The number of remaining empty shares. Maximum number is 7 and minimum number is 0.
  - last_edited_time: The date and time when the sacrifice information was last edited. There is a trigger in the database that updates this field when the sacrifice information is edited.
  - last_edited_by: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - notes: Additional information or notes.

Table 2: shareholders and its fields are:
  - shareholder_id: Primary key (a unique identifier field).
  - shareholder_name: The name of the shareholder.
  - phone_number: The phone number of the shareholder. -> varchar(13)
        When we receive an input from users regarding a phone_number, we will definitely check it and send it to db as +905555555555, but when we show it to users in the frontend, we should remove the +9 at the beginning and show it as 05555555555.
  - purchase_time: The time of share purchase. Default value is (now() AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Istanbul'::text) so don't send backend to this column value.
  - sacrifice_id: The associated sacrifice (foreign key). 
  - delivery_fee: Delivery fee. If the delivery type is "Toplu Teslim Noktası," an additional fee of 500 TL will be charged.
  - share_price: The price of a share associated with the sacrifice. This will comes from the sacrifice_animals table.
  - total_amount: The total amount to be paid. (share_price + delivery_fee)
  - paid_amount: The paid amount. 
  - remaining_payment: The remaining payment amount. (total_amount - paid_amount)
  - delivery_type: Delivery type (e.g., "kesimhane", "toplu-teslim-noktasi"). 
  - delivery_location: If Delivery type is "toplu-teslim-noktasi", this will be only two options: "yenimahalle-pazar-yeri" or "kecioren-otoparki". Otherwise "kesimhane".
  - sacrifice_consent: This a boolean value in db. But it is displayed as "vekalet" in UI and in forms, this field is shown in the drop-down menu as "vekalet-alindi" or "vekalet-alinmadi".
  - last_edited_time: The date and time when the shareholder information was last edited. There is a trigger in the database that updates this field when the shareholder information is edited.
  - last_edited_by: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - notes: Additional information or notes.

Table 3: change_logs and its fields are: 
  - event_id: Primary key - serial (a unique identifier field). 
  - table_name: Specifies which table was modified.
  - row_id: The ID of the modified record.
  - column_name: Column name where the change was made.
  - old_value
  - new_value
  - change_type: The type of operation performed (e.g., "Ekleme", "Güncelleme", "Silme"). 
  - description: Description of the change. 
  - change_owner: Information about the last person who edited the record (e.g., admin ID or name).
  - changed_at: The date and time when the change was made. 

Your are not limited to these if you find a more clean solution. But mention about the situation using other frameworks or libraries etc.
